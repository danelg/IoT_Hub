# IoT_Hub

The IoT_Hub consists of a frontend web application that allows users to control and monitor their IoT devices. Also, a server backend is built as a Spring Boot application to provide RESTful services to the frontend web application. It can also communicate with one or more IoT simulators via MQTT broker to control and report its status. It allows the user organize and control the devices in groups and monitor the power consumption of each device in real-time. This IoT_Hub is compatible to work with devices of any type of vendor. In this Project, an IoT simulator has been implemented in charge of communicating with the IoT_Hub using open protocols. In the following image we can see the GUI:
